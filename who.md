I currently do server-side Rails-ish development, with a bit of JS here and there at [Sky](http://sky.com).

Previously, I've worked at [Vista](http://www.wearevista.co.uk), one of the UK's leading communcations and events agencies. I have worked closely with, and have delivered web applications for the UK's largest <span style="color:#78BE20;">retailers</span> and <span style="color:#FABB00;">sporting events</span>.

I'm also a massive open source fanatic and user of free software.

### Education
I've graduated from the University of Leeds with a First in Electronic Engineering. Part way though my degree, I spent a year at the University of Illinois studying Electrical and Computer engineering. I've gained a masters in Embedded Systems, Control Systems Design, Wireless Sensor Networks and Medical Electronics.

For my final year thesis I developed a wireless sensor network, hardware interface, and web app to allow animal sanctuaries to monitor the environment of their enclosures.

I found that I'd much rather solve problems though software than hardware.
