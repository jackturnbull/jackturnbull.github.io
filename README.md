# Balzac

This is forked from [Balzac](https://github.com/ColeTownsend/Balzac-for-Jekyll) by [Cole Townsend](http://twnsnd.co/). The vast majority of this site is thanks to him so check out his site. I'm not a designer and my front-end is merely average so most of the CSS and pretty much all the grid system is thanks him.

## Demos

One of the main features I've added is to implement Javascript Demoscene scripts as part of the header. These come from [wab.com](http://www.wab.com) and I've modified the music library to play mute by default. There has been a volume button added to toggle volume. Check out the YAML in \_data/ and the demo-head and demo-body files in include/ if you want to see how it has been implemented.

## Refactor

I've also refactored the layouts down to one for post and one head file. This has the advantage of being able to pass in arguments to the head to set dark and all arguments for the individual post are now included in the post markdown itself.

This is free to use, fork, do whatever you want. You *cannot* sell this design though. You don't need to link me to it, but please contact me if you intend to market this theme. I am releasing premium versions of this design for select CMS's.
