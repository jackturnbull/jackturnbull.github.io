I do server-side development for the [Logistik Group](http://www.logistikgroup.com), one of the UK's leading communcations and events agencies. I have worked closely with, and have delivered web applications for the UK's largest <span style="color:#78BE20;">retailers</span> and <span style="color:#FABB00;">sporting events</span>.

I'm also a massive open source fanatic and user of free software.

### Education
I've graduated from the University of Leeds with a First in Electronic Engineering. Part way though my degree, I spent a year at the University of Illinois studying Electrical and Computer engineering. I've gained a masters in Embedded Systems, Control Systems Design, Wireless Sensor Networks and Medical Electronics.

For my final year thesis I developed a wireless sensor network, hardware interface, and web app to allow animal sanctuaries to monitor the environment of their enclosures.

I found that I'd much rather solve problems though software than hardware.
